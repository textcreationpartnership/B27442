            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

                  <l>He did no sooner come in field,</l>
                  <l>but both the seconds and the Earl,</l>
                  <l>Did plot contrive against Sir <hi>Gray,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>his courage purposel to q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#murp" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>eal,</l>
                  <l>The Earl began the quarrel then,</l>
                  <l>and Noble <hi>Gray</hi> did so outdare,</l>
                  <l>And said he was a better man,</l>
                  <l>then all the <hi>Grays</hi> in <hi>Scotland</hi> were,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And said to him come fight with me,</l>
                  <l>thou cowardise which art no man,</l>
                  <l>Which forced Valiant <hi>Gray</hi> to take,</l>
                  <l>his glitering Sword within his hand,</l>
                  <l>And so the battle fierce began,</l>
                  <l>and Noble <hi>Gray</hi> he plaid his part,</l>
                  <l>But yet at length unhappily,</l>
                  <l>the Earl he thrust him to the heart,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>This being done they dragd him too</l>
                  <l>a stinking ditch which there was by,</l>
                  <l>And robbed him of his Iewels rich,</l>
                  <l>and then they presently did fly,</l>
                  <l>Vnto the Crown whereas there coach,</l>
                  <l>stood ready for their safe convay,</l>
                  <l>But by a man it was found out,</l>
                  <l>which did them presently betray.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When they was took they did them search</l>
                  <l>whereas they found them full of Gold,</l>
                  <l>A golden watch and ring which cost,</l>
                  <l>five hundred pounds his man thus told,</l>
                  <l>They had them to the Iustice straight,</l>
                  <l>and he did send them to the Goal,</l>
                  <l>Whereas they wait for tryall now,</l>
                  <l>I think theres no man will them bail,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And thus I will conclude my song,</l>
                  <l>I wish all Traytors to be ware,</l>
                  <l>And not to murder as they do,</l>
                  <l>lest they fall in the hang-mans snare.</l>
